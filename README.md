# Black Jack - first JavaScript practice project (caracter based game for terminal)

The first project in my learning process.Unfortunately, I'd refactor it in many ways by now if I had the time (but I don't as I'm working very diligently on new projects to improve my skills). On the other hand, it's extremely fun to look back on my initial attempts and decipher this spaghetti monster.

## Focus of the exercise

- I used css modules to create the design
- Used the react-scroll and react-router libraries
- I built the sections more dynamically than in the exercise

## Launch and control

Start in terminal: node index.js

main menu:
- q: exit 
- n: new game

show starting hand after placing bet

- h: new card request
- s: stop

after stopping, the bank is drawn

after evaluation:
- q: exit 
- n: new game
